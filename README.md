# GitPeek

Welcome to GitPeek! This is a React Native project created with Expo to search and view GitHub profiles and bookmark your favourite repositories.
The application leverages Axios for making API requests to GitHub and uses the React Context API for state management.

## App Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eddb45fc-e3a6-4e8d-87bf-3f70cfa2a440

- **Profile Details**: View detailed information about GitHub profiles, including repositories, followers, and following.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive UI designed for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **Expo**: To streamline the development process.
- **Axios**: For handling API requests to GitHub.
- **React Context API**: For state management across the application.


This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cans4/GitPeek.git
    cd GitPeek
    ```
    
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Reset Project

To get a fresh project:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
